# optiRISCV - Papatya ISA Assembler
Basic assembler for Papatya ISA. (Advice you to check the CPU that the ISA is published for.)

Build for Computer Architecture Course in METU NCC by Electrical and Electronics Engineering students.

It is fork from optiMIPS MIPS assembler updated for custom Papatya ISA that is inspired by RISCV set. 

Follow comments inside the assemblr.py for adding new instructions.

### Capabilities:

There are two modes: Batch and Interactive.

In interactive mode user can write one line of MIPS code and convert it to hex.

In batch mode user can convert file full of instructins to hex.

To use batch mode add a file called program.src in the same directory that contains MIPS code and the program.

Example program.src and output file is added.
